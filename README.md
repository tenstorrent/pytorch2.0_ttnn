# Visit [TT-Forge](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-forge) for our latest compiler project

**Pytorch 2.0 TT-NN** is no longer maintained, please consider using [TT-Forge](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-forge) instead.

The PyTorch 2.0 TT-NN Compiler enables seamless execution of PyTorch models on [Tenstorrent](https://tenstorrent.com/) AI accelerators. 
By leveraging the TT-NN backend, you can achieve significant performance improvements while maintaining PyTorch's familiar API.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

Install from the repo:
```bash
pip install git+https://bitbucket.org/tenstorrent/pytorch2.0_ttnn
```
or as an editable package from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tenstorrent/pytorch2.0_ttnn.git
cd pytorch2.0_ttnn
pip install -e .
```

### ✨ Basic Usage

**Option 1: Eager Mode:** get your model running by switching to a TT device
```python
import torch
import torch_ttnn

model = YourModel()

device = ttnn.open_device(device_id=0)
model.to(torch_ttnn.ttnn_device_as_torch_device(device))

output = model(input_data)
```

**Option 2: Compilation Mode (Recommended):** get more perf with a JIT compiler
```python
import torch
import torch_ttnn

model = YourModel()

device = ttnn.open_mesh_device(ttnn.MeshShape(1, 2))  # 1x2 device grid
option = torch_ttnn.TorchTtnnOption(device=device, data_parallel=2)

model = torch.compile(model, backend=torch_ttnn.backend, options=option)
output = model(input_data)
```

## 📊 Model Support

We've extensively tested the compiler across a diverse range of model architectures. Here's a summary of our validation results:

| Model                                                              | Status   |   Batch |   Compiled First Run (ms) |   Original Throughput (Inferences Per Second) |   Compiled Throughput (Inferences Per Second) |   Accuracy (%) | Torch Ops Before (Unique Ops)   | Torch Ops Remain (Unique Ops)   |   To/From Device Ops |

### Explanation of Metrics

**Model**: Name of the model.  
**Status**: Indicates whether the model is:
- ✅ End-to-end on device: All PyTorch operations have been converted to TT-NN operations.
- 🚧 Compiled: The converted model runs but some operations still fallback to PyTorch. This may be due to an unsupported operation or configuration.
- ❌ Traced: The model does not run but its PyTorch operations are traced for future development. This may indicate a temporary incompatibility with a compiler pass.  
**Batch**: Batch size used for inference  
**Compiled First Run (ms)**: Time until the first compiled run finishes (ms), including compilation time and warming caches.  
**Original Throughput (Inferences Per Second)**: Execution throughput (in inferences per second) of the model before conversion.  
**Compiled Throughput (Inferences Per Second)**: Execution throughput (in inferences per second) of the model after conversion, once caches are warm.  
**Accuracy (%)**: Model accuracy on a predefined test dataset after conversion.  
**Torch Ops Before (Unique Ops)**: The total number of operations used by the model in the original Torch implementation. The number in parentheses represents the total unique ops.  
**Torch Ops Remain (Unique Ops)**: The total number of operations used after conversion to TT-NN. The number in parentheses represents the total unique ops.  
**To/From Device Ops**: The number of `to/from_device` operations (data transfer to/from the device).
