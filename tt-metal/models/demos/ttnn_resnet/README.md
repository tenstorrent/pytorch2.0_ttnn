# ResNet50 Demo

## Introduction
ResNet50 is a deep convolutional neural network architecture with 50 layers, designed to enable training of very deep networks by using residual learning to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.

## Details

+ The entry point to the Metal ResNet model is `ResNet` in `ttnn_functional_resnet50.py`.
+ The model picks up certain configs and weights from TorchVision pretrained model. We have used `torchvision.models.ResNet50_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1` version from TorchVision as our reference.
+ Our ImageProcessor on the other hand is based on `microsoft/resnet-50` from huggingface.
