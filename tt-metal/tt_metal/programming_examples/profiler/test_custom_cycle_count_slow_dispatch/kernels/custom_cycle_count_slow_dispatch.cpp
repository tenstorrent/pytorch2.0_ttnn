/**
 * LOOP_COUNT and LOOP_SIZE provide the ability to decide how many cycles this kernel takes.
 * With a large enough LOOP_COUNT and a LOOP_SIZEs within icache size, cycle count will be
 * very close to LOOP_COUNT x (LOOP_SIZE + loop_overhead). loop_overhead is 2 cycle 1 for
 * addi and 1 for branch if not zero.
 *
 * Keeping LOOP_SIZE constant and suitable for all 5 risc ichahes, The diff between to runs
 * with LOOP_COUNT and LOOP_COUNT + 1 should be the same across all riscs and it should be
 * LOOP_COUNT + 2 cycles
 *
 * More info on tt-metal issue #515
